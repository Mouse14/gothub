# GotHub

## What is it?

GotHub is a library for interfacing with GitHub, for the Go programming
language.

## How do I pronounce the name?

You can pronounce it like "got hub", "goth hub" for those darker times, or
really, however the heck you feel like pronouncing it.

## Why are you working on this?

Well, simply because I wanted a client-side library with which to utilize
GitHub's APIs, in a similar fashion to the
[PyGithub](https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub) library for Python.

## How do I get it?

A simple `go get github.com/nesv/gothub` should be sufficient.

## I can haz docs plz?

Those are on their way.
